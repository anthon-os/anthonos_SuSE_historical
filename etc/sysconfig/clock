## Path:		System/Environment/Clock
## Description:		Information about your timezone and time
#
# Be aware that the time reference of the CMOS/HW clock has been
# forwarded to /etc/adjtime, the file used by hwclock(8),
# systemd(1), and the kernel as reference for the CMOS/HW clock.

## Type:		list(yes,no,)
## Description:		Write back system time to the hardware clock
#
# Is set to "yes" write back the system time to the hardware
# clock at reboot or shutdown. Usefull if hardware clock is
# much more inaccurate than system clock.  Set to "no" if
# system time does it wrong due e.g. missed timer interrupts.
# If set to "no" the hardware clock adjust feature is also
# skipped because it is rather useless without writing back
# the system time to the hardware clock.
#
# Note that you need to enable boot.clock for this feature to take
# effect.
#
# defaults to 'yes' if unset
#
SYSTOHC=""
## Description:		Write back system time if if already done by kernel
## Type:		list(no,yes)
#
# Is set to "yes" write back the system time to the hardware
# clock at reboot or shutdown eveb if this is done by the kernel
# in the so called ``Eleven Minute Mode''.
#
FORCE_SYSTOHC="no"
## Description:		HW clock is not able to use years outside 1994-1999.
## Type:		string
## Type:		list(yes,no)
#
# Indicates that the Hardware Clock is incapable of storing years
# outside the range 1994-1999.
#
BADYEAR="no"
## Description:		Overrides the default device file name
## Type:		string
#
# Overrides the default /dev file name, which is /dev/rtc on many
# platforms but may be /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, and so on.
#
HCTOSYS_DEVICE=""
## Description:		Do or do not not run hwclock(8)
## Type:		list(yes,no,)
#
# Set this to yes if it is possible to access the hardware clock,
# or no if it is not.  On some platforms (s390 or xen) this may
# overwritten by the service its self.
#
USE_HWCLOCK="yes"
## Description:		Correct systematic drift of the HW clock
## Type:		list(yes,no,)
#
# Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to account for
# systematic drift since the last time the clock was set or
# adjusted. By default off as this can cause trouble.  For
# systems using localtime for HW clock this will ignored.
#

# Timezone (e.g. CET or Asia/Tokyo). The value should correspond
# to the contents of the /etc/localtime file and is for internal
